# ✈ Flight Fare Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the flight ticket prices based on various input features such as airline, source, destination, duration, and more. The project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building regression models for accurate price prediction.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on flight fare data
- Visualize key patterns affecting flight prices
- Build and evaluate regression models to predict fares
- Calculate performance metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²)

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- NumPy & Pandas  
- Matplotlib (Pyplot)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed flight duration, total stops, airlines, departure/arrival times, and prices
- Plotted distribution plots, bar charts, and trend lines
- Detected outliers and missing values
- Extracted useful features from date and time columns

## 🤖 Model Evaluation Metrics
To assess model performance, the following regression metrics were calculated:
- *MAE*: Mean Absolute Error  
- *MSE*: Mean Squared Error  
- *RMSE*: Root Mean Squared Error  
- *R² Score*: Coefficient of Determination

## 📌 Results
- Successfully built a regression model that predicts ticket prices based on input features
- Insights on which features most influence fare prices (e.g., airline, total stops, duration)
- Model performance evaluated using RMSE and R² score
